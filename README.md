## What is this?

This is a website made to demonstrate my newfound knowledge of Wordpress, via using WordPress as a backend and React as a frontend. Uploaded to this GitHub is the React frontend for the website. As initially uploaded is the completed part one of the assessment, this project will conclude when I add the wordpress customizer window as well as SEO best practices like meta tags and the 'Helmet' react npm package.

> Note: Backend not included
